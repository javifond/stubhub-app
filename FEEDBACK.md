In this document, we would like to receive your feedback after completing the code test.

We find your opinion on the test very valuable, and we will take it into account when evaluating it. It also helps us improve it for future occasions :D

We've provided some questions, but please feel free to add any additional comments you consider appropriate.

- How much time did you dedicate?

  > I spent in the code challenge in total 27h, within 3 days.

- Did you find it challenging?

  > Yes, pretty much. The test is very complete, touches practically
  > every aspect of the FE web development, it was nicely challenging.

- Was there anything that seemed repetitive or unnecessary?

  > Like I mentioned before, in my opinion, it was very complete.
  > Perhaps, the navigation from Categories to Events could be avoided.
  > But overall, for me was pretty solid test.

- If you had more time, what would you have done that you didn't have time to finish?

  > I would implement e2e tests and I will work more in the error handling, especially how to address errors from the API calls.
  > Also, I would organize a bit better the CSS, although, I tried to head to a UI component library approach, there is extreme value in modularize even more the components, using for example StoryBook.
  > There is always room to improve, I left few TODOs pending to complete/improve.

- Did you provide instructions for running your project?

  > Yes, in the INSTRUCTIONS file.

- Do you have any comments about the test?
  > Only, that I really enjoy implementing it, I would have dedicated much more time, but next week I will be a bit busy, XMAS preparations.
  > I want to thank you guys for the opportunity and I hope you enjoy reading my code the same as I enjoy writing it.

#### Thank you very much for your time and effort :D!
